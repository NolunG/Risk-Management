# Risk-Management
Basic Risk-Metrics Calculation Project to expand my understanding of the topic and practice it's implementation. All the calculations are done in R, on COMPUSTAT data. 
Added the knitted file of R to view the results of the exercise.
Completed following risk metrics calculation as part of the exercise.

All the below calculations are done for a randomly selected portfolio for every year from 1990 to 2020 (yearly rebalancing)

Task 1: Calculated Semi Beta, Downside Beta and Co-skewness. The formulaes of the calculated metrics are added as PNG photos in the repository.

Task 2: Calculating Value-at-Risk (Var) and Expected Shortfall (ES) of the portfolio. Pretty straight forward The formulaes are attached in PNG format.

Task 3: Modeling volatility time series for the given portfolio using JPMorgan Risk Metric and GARCH(Generalized Autoregressive Conditinoal Heteroskedacity) models
